title: About
---

I'm Seamus, a data scientist recently relocated to Minneapolis from San Francisco.

I'm currently exploring new opportunities, both remote and local to the Minneapolis area. Most recently, I was an analytics manager at Uber where I led a team of data analysts focused on improving the customer experience of Uber Eats.

I developed this blog to collect and develop my thoughts on things I'm learning and projects I'm working on. This blog is an exercise in learning in the open and will publish works-in-progress, in line with the [David Robinson's](http://varianceexplained.org/about/) [philosophy of the value of public work](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work/).
