The goal of this blog is to collect and develop my thoughts on things I'm learning and projects I'm working on. This blog is an exercise in learning in the open and will publish works-in-progress, in line with the [David Robinson's](http://varianceexplained.org/about/) [philosophy of the value of public work](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work/).
